counts this down for you and provides an estimate of ETA on the map display .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                      I have to hit too many buttons to get back to the map display when, for example, I am entering POIs .\\n13                                                                                        Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n14                                                                                                     In the map view, if you touch the display button to the left of the  Menu  button  , it brings up a display that features some stats about your trip and includes a compass of sorts .\\n15                                                                                                                The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                  For me, the visual display combined with this level of verbal instruction is just right .\\n17                                                                                                                    So I finally got the Nuvi 255w after months of analizing and comparing wit other brands, adding 3 days of looking arownd in Circuit City and Best Buy stores displays .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It also can display and speak many languages .\\n19                                                                                                                                            I am thinking about buying another one of these for my parents because their native language is Chinese and Garmin 255W speaks and display it !\\n20

                                    The display is great, and is very clear .\\n21                                                                                                                                                      The instructions sometimes are a little difficult to understand, but written at the top of the display is the next turn information .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                          The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n23                                                                                                                                Through this

and the wide screen display .\\n25                                                                                                                                                              Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n26

with :\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                               But is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .\\n28

                                                                                                                                                                    I have really sensitive eyes and sometimes the display is too much, but there is an adjustment for it .\\n30

and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n32                                                                                                                                               ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                     The unit speaks street names, has a beautiful display and a very intuitive interface .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .\\n35

.\\n36    I thought I had seen a turn by turn display but if you pick a location and wait at the GO icon you will see a Route Info slide out but it just tells you the distance and time, though if you tap on it it will show the map so you can zoom around and see the trip as it planned it .\\n37

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The Garmin has a nice 3d display .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                          One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I like the larger display and quicker updating of maps .\\n41                                                                                                                  I really like the versatility of picking destination points either by inputing an explicit address, uploading from Google Maps, or just touching a point on the display .\\n42

                                          It is very easy to use, and when driving in the US  , it displays the speed limit and your speed, which is helpful when converting from Kms to Miles .\\n45

have the names of streets written down on the display roads as you pass them .\\n46

horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

.\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                           The 750 just displays text on the top line for upcoming turns without the arrow .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                     The 255 also automatically adjusts the font size of displayed text so that even lengthy text will fit .\\n4                                                                                                                                        Another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed .\\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The 255W has a really clear display that's easy to see in any light .\\n6                                                                                                              The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .\\n7                              The widescreen display makes it possible to view the names of roads that you are passing on the screen, , which makes it much easier to differentiate between which road to turn on when there are two streets on your right   that are only one house apart .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bad ,  My unit only displays elevation contours at zoom levels of 20 miles or higher .\\n9                                                                                                                                       UPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I also miss the display of how far you have yet to go on your route .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                  My old unit counts this down for you and provides an estimate of ETA on the map display .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                      I have to hit too many buttons to get back to the map display when, for example, I am entering POIs .\\n13                                                                                        Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n14                                                                                                     In the map view, if you touch the display button to the left of the  Menu  button  , it brings up a display that features some stats about your trip and includes a compass of sorts .\\n15                                                                                                                The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                  For me, the visual display combined with this level of verbal instruction is just right .\\n17                                                                                                                    So I finally got the Nuvi 255w after months of analizing and comparing wit other brands, adding 3 days of looking arownd in Circuit City and Best Buy stores displays .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It also can display and speak many languages .\\n19                                                                                                                                            I am thinking about buying another one of these for my parents because their native language is Chinese and Garmin 255W speaks and display it !\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The display is great, and is very clear .\\n21                                                                                                                                                      The instructions sometimes are a little difficult to understand, but written at the top of the display is the next turn information .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                          The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n23                                                                                                                                Through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .\\n24                                                                                                                                                  The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .\\n25                                                                                                                                                              Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I have checked the display in three areas I am familiar with :\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                               But is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Even setting the display to maximum detail is far from adequate .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                    I have really sensitive eyes and sometimes the display is too much, but there is an adjustment for it .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The display is extremely legible both in bright sunlight and at night .\\n31   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n32                                                                                                                                               ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                     The unit speaks street names, has a beautiful display and a very intuitive interface .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                I also like the way the display changes background color for day and night and of course you have control of that as well .\\n36    I thought I had seen a turn by turn display but if you pick a location and wait at the GO icon you will see a Route Info slide out but it just tells you the distance and time, though if you tap on it it will show the map so you can zoom around and see the trip as it planned it .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                Well when I saw that the 255W had the next turn proudly displayed in the upper left corner I jumped at it .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Garmin has a nice 3d display .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                          One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I like the larger

horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35

felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

                                                                                                                                                            The driver seat is still soft and mostly uncomfortable .\\n13                                                                                                                                  The ride is comfortable and it seems to ride a little higher than the average sedan, which I like .\\n14                                                                                                                                            I've had 3 BMWs and only one of them could offer a more comfortable ride than the Camry .\\n15

                                       The previous soft seats were replaced with hard cheap ones which are very very uncomfortable and give me back pain .\\n17                                                                                                                                             If you keep in mind that the Camry is a comfort car, you may even enjoy the experience .\\n18                                                                                                         While the 4 cylinder does not have the punch of the Honda Accord 4 cylinder, the comfort and quietness of the ride won out .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                  No hestitation, comfort is great in front in back .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                       I feel uncomfortable driving this car and will get rid of it .\\n21

                                                         I was surprised by how quiet the cabin was and just how comfortable it was to sit in and drive .\\n23                                                                                                                                   This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage \\n24                                                                        We have had this Camry about two years now, and it is not a boring car but it is smooth, comfortable and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car .\\n25                                                                                                                          I'd highly recommend anyone buy this car if they are seeking an affordable, comfortable, reliable vehicle .\\n26                                                                                                                                                     You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27

                                                                                         great ride, quiet comfortable spacious cabin, superior electronics  , fair price and good looks .\\n30

comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33

                            I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                    The seats were very comfortable .\\n38                                                                                                                                         The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                                      I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                   Very comfortable, quiet

than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50

                                                             I feel that the Camry just gets better and better in terms of comfort, styling and performance with each generation .\\n53

                  My friends say my car is just like a Lexus and I have to agree, very comfortable and beautiful .\\n63                                                                                                                                           Seats are comfortable, but wish the seat bottoms tilted back more into a bucket position .\\n64

         Turns out, it was one of the smoothest, most comfortable rides ever .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                I bought this car smitten by its exterior look and interior comfort .\\n69

                                                                                                                                                                             It is very reliable and

quiet ride with low levels of road and wind noise .\\n73                                                                                                                                                            The seats are way to low to the ground making long drives uncomfortable .\\n74                                                                                                                                                 I do not find the front seats as comfortable as the seats in my old 96 Ford taurus .\\n75                                                                                                                Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                            Very comfortable, quite and smooth ride .\\n77                                                                              The sound system is incredible, the seats are comfortable, the controls are ergonomic and straight forward and the take off power is quite impressive .\\n78                                                                                                                                           My passengers are expecially happy with it and love the room, comfort, and adjustability .\\n79                                                                                                 On longer trips, however, they have a tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works flawlessly, comfortable seats

great,comfortable and gas mileage great .\\n84                                                                                                                                   I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a comfortable ride as well as good fuel economy .\\n85                                                                                                                             The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                   Comfortable and quiet with excellent gas mileage .\\n88                                                                                                                           Comfort is great, mileage is good overall, better on the road than expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                                            It is so comfortable and drives perfect .\\n96                                                                                                              Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .\\n97                                                                                                                                                                           Leather seats are comfortable, Nav system is easy to use .\\n98                                                                I only have a vibration shimmy problem at 70 mph, visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leather seats were comfortable .\\n100                                                                                                                                                                                                 Leather interior very comfortable .\\n101                                                                                                                                My conclusion after doing a ton of research regarding safety, reliability, comfort and gas mileage :\\n102                                                                                                                           the Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .\\n103                                                                                        Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104                                                                                                                                                While the '03 was roomy and comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort

                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage has been a bit disappointing, but it has been improving .\\n32                                                                                                                                        the variable cylinder management changes to 4 cyl when not under load, this helps with fuel mileage .\\n33                                                                                                                                               After owning a Honda Accord EX   I had to go back to the Honda the gas mileage can't be beat .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                             Gas mileage is around 22, 23 in town and 29, 30 on the highway .\\n35

                                                                                                                                   It's no 8 cylinder GT, but it also gets double the gas mileage and so far, no problems .\\n37                                                                                                                              Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38                                                                                                                                                          The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40

great gas mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25 .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                       I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44

cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47

                           Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72

keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76

drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80

                                  It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83

my computer doen't charge well with either of my iPods so the battery life is possibly greater than I thought if using a wall outlet .\\n33

brands, , in spite of the warnings about unworkable battery chargers and inoperative batteries I bought the Asus Eee PC .\\n25

to coast with it, waits, etc .\\n51

outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .\\n78              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n79

.\\n156  One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n157

brightness or radio anyway .\\n195

to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47

so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49

outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

                                                   The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

shower .\\n54

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

hitting you no joke !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

                  The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n75

from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76

 .\\n77

I liked the built, in features of Vista and of course the appearance, but I prefered the stability and speed of XP even with a high, end system .\\n19

                       Windows 7 Ultimate is there too off course, but I personally can't bring myself to spend that much more money just to get a tiny few features that I know I will never use like multi, language support and BitLocker .\\n23

I personally don't find useful, BUT if in the future I do need them, they're there .\\n25

                                               Vista has more features than XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .\\n27   Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28

                                                         I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

terms of any new worthwhile features ?\\n31

                                                                                                                                                            I really wanted to like Vista with all it's cool new features, but unfortunately it was a disaster because it just didn't work .\\n33

                                    I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used

pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51

from the upgrade .\\n52

option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54

to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56

                           A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .\\n58                                                                                                    If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n59

their services .\\n85

business center .\\n86

to walk in the dark at night and scare my mother or pay for a taxi or bus, but sit around and eat comfortably in my pajamas was well worth the cost to me .\\n8

            Room service was extortionate though, very very expensive, so we didnt bother, as food outlets a few minutes walk away .\\n11

We also did the chicago food tasting tour which you can find here on travelzoo, this was fantastic and well worth the $40 pp .\\n12

so that you can store your own food personal items, the sensor will send a signal to the hotel and you will be charged .\\n13

We passed on the restaurants simply because the cost of breakfast was insane and the food tends to be mediocre .\\n14

            An added bonus was the Executive Lounge with complimentary food throughout the day .\\n16

seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n37

were both excellent .\\n38                                                                                                                                                             This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n39

                                                                                                                                           The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41

             One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                       They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .\\n46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   We were very impressed with the service we received .\\n48

                                                                                       Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service

breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51

quick .\\n52

                                                                                                                                                        I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55

recommend due to the room service .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                      There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .\\n58

Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n60                                                                                                         Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n61

walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .\\n62

service, and they are open 24 hours .\\n64

sure if there was a charge involved for that service, as there was no information about that anywhere .\\n74   The hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use

Rooms all appear to either look out onto the river and the bustle of Chicago or, on the other side, will face Navy Pier,   .\\n8

                                                                                                                                                              The hotel is shaped like a triangle from the sky, and this strange shape combined with the location of the elevator shafts made many rooms quite noisy .\\n14

generic, lacking the style of some of Chicago's newer hotels   .\\n91

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It seems most of the rooms here have great views and mine was no exception .\\n93

were updated with new mattresses, televisions and desks .\\n94

allocated under the control of large travel agencies, I immediately called a friend and had them book me using hotels .\\n96

                                                                                                                                                                                                    For 2 nights there were 4 of us and for the last night only 2, so I was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds .\\n99                                                                                                                                        I originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .\\n100                                                                                                                                the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !\\n101                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The rooms were clean, and upscale for the low price we paid .\\n102

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Most importantly, the rooms were quiet .\\n105

from a top flight hotel .\\n106                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The hotel is really pretty, but the rooms need some upgrading to be considered anywhere near a 4 5 star hotel .\\n107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I would say the best part about this hotel was that it was very very quiet from inside the rooms .\\n108                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The decor of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated, looks like it hasn't been touched for years .\\n109                                                                                                                                                               The Swissotel was a great place to stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .\\n110                                                                                                                 We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .\\n111                                                                                                                                               So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .\\n112                                                                                                                  Some of the other hotels in the same class in Chicago might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don\\u0092t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .\\n113                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .\\n114                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well .\\n115                                                                                                                                           We didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a &quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .\\n116                                                                                                                                                       From talking to other guests, I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !\\n117                                                                                                                                                                                                                  One thing that struck me as backward is that they charge $10 per 24 hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .\\n118                                                                                                                                                                          I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .\\n119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !\\n120                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Then we were told that rooms on the top 5 or 6 floors are all non, smoking .\\n121

menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n41

                                              There are no bottle openers or cork screws in the room so ask room service for them if you need them .\\n43

they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it .\\n44

                     The service is pleasant enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London   on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

                                      This is suppose to be a full service hotle, but I would only classify it at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72

and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50
